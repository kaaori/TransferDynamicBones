# TransferDynamicBones

# Always back up your avatars before using! You never know what could go wrong.

To use:
- Add to your VRChat avatar
- Add your base model into the provided box
- Click Transfer button and enjoy.

It will also transfer your dynamic bone colliders, though some manual adjustment may be needed.

# Things
- Transferring between differently scaled models may need some things (Like radii, offsets, and other non-scaled factors) to be manually changed
